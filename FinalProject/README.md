# Final Project

This semester, we've learned some great tools for 
frontend, backend, and database development. Now, 
we will put them all together to make an amazing final
project!

## Outline

This project will involve building a web app complete
with a backend that connects to a Firestore database.

You will be working in groups of 2 to complete this final 
project. Your method of collaboration is up to you, 
but using GitHub is strongly advised. VS Code also has 
an excellent live coding tool which you can use if you prefer
to do all work together.

We will hold a Git(Hub) workshop on April 18th from 
7:30-8:30pm. 

## Requirements

- Firebase authentication system
- Create a backend using GET and POST requests
- Have a React frontend which talks to the backend and
puts/fetches data from the database.
- Use conditional rendering (at least once)
- Use ES6 syntax (includes arrow functions, spreading, destructuring)
- Use Functional programming (map/filter/reduce)
- Use React Hooks
- Optional: Use an external API in your backend

## Suggested Project Ideas

- Picnic items
- Card game
- Blog
- Forum
- Chat bot
- Wiki
- School management db 

You are not limited to these ideas, they are just some things
we've seen in the past that might help you get started! 

## Milestones 

The project will be divided into a number of milestones to help 
you progress in a reasonable way.

Each milestone is due before lecture on its due date.

### Milestone 0 - April 17 by 11:59 PM 

Find a partner and fill out this form: 

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd1SXLkvxTvP4FaVZfbz2Da1X0lT7J8SKKYWv7siBLL7riLHA/viewform

### Milestone 1 - April 22

- Have some of either the frontend or backend done (you choose). 
This can use any hardcoded data, but it is vital that you have
this before the next milestone.

### Milestone 2 - April 29

- Have an authentication system set up using Firebase.
- More progress on what you didn't focus on in milestone 1 (i.e 
do frontend if you did backend in the first milestone and vice versa
if you did frontend).

### Milestone 3 - May 6

- Frontend and backend are bridged together with data fetching.
- App is deployed on Firebase.
- App is fully styled.

## Grading 

- Frontend (25%)
  - Use of ES6
  - Component structure
  - Use of hooks 
  - Functional programming

- Backend (25%) 
  - Use of ES6
  - Has both GET and POST requests
  - Is connected to a database
  - Functional programming

- Database/Auth (15%)
  - Data fetching
  - Data insertion
  - Authentication (using Firebase auth)

- Styling (5%)

- Deployment (5%)

- Code style and file structure (5%)

- Effort (20%)
  - This may seem like an arbitrary measure, but we expect most people to 
  get most of the points here; the only way to lose points is if it is 
  clear that not a lot of effort has been put in or you are consistently 
  missing milestones.

## Submission

Submission will be a zip file of your code, along with a 
README containing a description of the project, a list of 
group members and netIDs, a link to the deployed site, 
and anything else that you think is important for us
to know.

As always, do not include your `node_modules`.
